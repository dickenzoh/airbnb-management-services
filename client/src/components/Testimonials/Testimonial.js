Private and quiet, very safe (UN HQ, US embassy, Australia, etc) are 15 minutes away, meaning security in this area is tight. 2 rivers mall is 10 minutes away. Carrefour supermarket, restaurants. I mean, you are sorted. This is the place. And it's way too cheap at first I was doubtful. To be honest, I'm certain to come here again. It's worth more than you pay for. Shops and public transportation are 100m away. Before you book elsewhere, check this one out.",
